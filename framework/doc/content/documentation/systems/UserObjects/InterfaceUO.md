# InterfaceUO

The `InterfaceUO` demonstrate the use of the `InterfaceUserObject`
It computes the average material property across the interface. This object is used
for testing purposes and should not be modified.

It compute the average material property (AMP) across the interface:
t=0-> AMP=0 t(ss)-> AMP=7

It also compute the average variable jump (AVJ)
t=0-> AVJ=0, t(ss)-> AVJ=0
